I pretty much followed the reccomended planning guide for this project. I started by building the game logic, then the api, then styling.
I tried to stick to one problem at a time. I tried my best to stay organized but I feel that it still ended up being messy. Thats ok because it works!  

Unsolved: Multiplayer, getting different game statistics, more cool animations
